data-grid-id="734802d2-8948-458a-a2a2-dd26c958de05">It was developed by Croteam, makers of Serious Sam.</li><li data-grid-id="aafbf5ff-f143-426b-8d8b-b985c3bb2efd">It was pretty highly rated.</li><li data-grid-id="816fb82b-ff72-4c19-90e9-d0620b198eec">It's image on the storefront was a robot holding a cat Dr. Evil-style.</li></ul><p>Generally, I was pretty excited to play it!</p><p>The game is a 3D first-person puzzle game, and it plays very much like Portal, or the Quantum Conundrum. That's not a bad thing - it is leveraging the familiar controls & visual style of past games to better put the focus on the puzzles. And the game does an excellent job of teaching you the very sparse puzzle mechanics bit by bit, as you work through your first 20-30 minutes of the game. Conventional wisdom still says that every game must carefully teach players about every bit of mechanical interaction - click to move, press Esc to bring up the menu, press A to jump, blah blah blah. So I was pleased that the Talos Principle mostly skipped that, and put my focus on easy puzzles right away.</p><p>Of course that also feeds into the narrative fiction of the game - which is a bit obtuse but which I pretty comfortable identified as "I'm an A.I. robot being tested for cognitive capacity" - hence the tests.</p><p>I have a pretty specific fear when starting a puzzle game - which is always that the difficulty curve will go wrong. Either the game stays too easy all the way through (ugh) or it becomes too twitchy or otherwise difficult. (Which means I'll still finish it, but will spend 10x longer than I wanted to do so, and all the joy will be drained out of it.) But the Talos Principle neatly side-stepped that issue by changing the point of the game. Because it almost immediately dropped three-layers-deep in terms of narrative complexity. Because this game isn't actually about the puzzles at all! Oh no - this game is about your <i data-grid-id="565f4908-1f20-4566-bb21-c61347b861a2">soul</i>.</p><p>On the surface, you're a robot performing tasks. But quickly the game acknowledges that <i data-grid-id="139803d0-f41e-45ec-8d0c-9f99b8765889">actually</i> you're in a video game - one based on the serious same engine, no less! But then the game tells you that "you" are actually the one <i data-grid-id="f6141f34-a828-457a-9fd8-7e97dd5e93d0">controlling</i> the video game. And it is this "you" that the game is subjecting to a wonderfully complex & wordy Turing-test.</p><p>Is the robot in the game a person? What does it mean to have free will? Do you, the player, (and the one reading this) have free will? How can you demonstrate that to a game? If you're just solving puzzles, don't you appear to be less than human? How can you pass a turing test administered by (presumably) a video game? What does the game want from you to prove that you have a soul? Will the judgement of the game matter to you? Will it matter within the game? Do you want to keep solving box puzzles within the simulation, even if you know that you can't win? Does quitting mean winning? Is there a secret objective? If so, isn't that objective itself just another puzzle?</p><p>This game asks a lot of questions - many of them directly via console-like interfaces. Initially I was answering these questions as my character - the robot in the sim (or in the video game of the sim...) but eventually I started answering the questions AS MYSELF. And it was oddly pleasing/frustrating that I still couldn't quite seem to convince the game that I was a human.</p><p>Because the really satisfying thing about playing the Talos Principle is, to me, the way it really gave me something interesting to think about. Although the game has hundreds of 3D box puzzles - some quite tricky - the real puzzle of the game is a classic problem of philosophy - are we alive? What does that mean? How can we prove it? And then whatever answers we come up with, the game asks us - what will that mean when we inevitably die? Will solving these puzzles help us be happier? Feel more accomplished? Will solving these puzzles give a leg up to future generations of humans?</p><p>This last one is especially confounding to me, because while I deeply want to help humans advance, which seems to mean helping us advance and not simply re-tread the same problems & questions over and over... I still really want to give out copies of the Talos Principle to my thoughtful friends - to let them cover the same ground I've been wallowing in for the past 6 weeks. And so it seems that in the scope of human history my time with the Talos Principle has advanced us not at all. In fact it does the opposite - since it's a waste of time that perpetuates itself - encouraging players like me to push it on others.</p><p>But that's quite an accomplishment, for a video game.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="47"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="49"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="50"><span data-reactid="51"><!-- react-empty: 52 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="53"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="54">The Talos Principle</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="56"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="57"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
